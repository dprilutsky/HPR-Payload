-Need to toss values that server receives if client doesn't want them (otherwise serial buffer gets filled)


***ToDo***
-Set the port the radio is on through the client interface
-Keep track of buffer size on serial
-Add error check in payload if init fails
-Set up folder for flights if it doesn't exist already
-Error check if file can't open
-Add difference between data processing and data sending rates
-Shorten length of data (cut significant figures)
-What should happen when pi is not connected? (on both ends: pi and comp)
-What happens if code on PI crashes? should be automatically re-booted
-Should not be allowed to delete the file that we are flying
-Add filtering to data processing
-Fix inverted flight heading bug


When i end recording
	-file is closed
	-flight number is reset to "No Flight Selected"
	-Start recording should be dissabled until flight is selected

When I start recording
	-start writing data to file
	-set recording to true
	-reset the time

-Update flight list
-Remove delete flight records
